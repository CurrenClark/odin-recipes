    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Unagi (freshwater eel) is considered an expensive delicacy in Japan, and it's not an everyday dish. I did a quick research and found out that 26.2% of people eat unagi “about once every 6 months”, followed by “once every 2 to 3 months” at 16.8%, “less than once a year” at 16.1%, and “once a year” at 15.8%.</p>
<p>Unadon (Grilled Eel Rice Bowl) is a popular Japanese delicacy that you can easily make at home for lunch or dinner. This delicious unagi bowl features perfectly grilled eel fillets glazed with my homemade unagi sauce and nestled on a bed of hot steamed rice. The tantalizing aroma of the sweet caramelized glaze is enough to make your mouth water!<p/>
